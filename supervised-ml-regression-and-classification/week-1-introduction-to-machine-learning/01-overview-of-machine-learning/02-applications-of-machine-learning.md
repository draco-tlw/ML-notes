## **Why Machine Learning is Pervasive**

### **The Limits of Explicit Programming**

- Machine Learning grew as a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) because many complex, real-world problems proved too difficult to solve by writing explicit, rule-based programs.
- **Core Idea:** For many tasks, the only viable solution was to create systems that could **learn from data** on their own.
- **Examples of such tasks include:**
  - Web search ranking
  - Human speech recognition
  - Diagnosing diseases from X-rays
  - Building self-driving cars

### **The Goal of This Course**

- You will learn the most important **state-of-the-art algorithms**.
- You will gain crucial **practical tips and tricks** for making these algorithms perform well.
- You will get hands-on experience by **implementing the algorithms** yourself.

### **Future & Economic Impact ðŸš€**

- Machine learning is expected to significantly impact nearly every industry, extending far beyond the software sector into areas like manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare.
- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** This is the long-term dream of building machines with human-level intelligence. While it is still a distant goal, learning algorithms are seen as the most promising path toward it.
- **Economic Value:** A McKinsey study estimates that AI and machine learning will create an additional **$13 trillion** in value annually by the year 2030.
- **Career Opportunities:** Due to the massive number of untapped applications, there is a vast and unfulfilled demand for people with machine learning skills.
