## **What is Machine Learning?**

### **A Formal Definition**

- **Machine Learning** is formally defined as "the field of study that gives computers the **ability to learn without being explicitly programmed**."
- This definition is attributed to **Arthur Samuel**, a pioneer in the field of AI and computer gaming.

### **Core Concepts üë®‚Äçüíª**

- **Learning from Experience:** The core idea is that a program can improve its performance on a task by learning from data or experience.
- **Arthur Samuel's Checkers Program (1950s):**
  - Samuel, who was not a great checkers player himself, wrote a program that learned to play checkers.
  - He had the computer play **tens of thousands of games against itself**.
  - By observing which board positions led to wins versus losses, the program learned to identify good and bad positions, eventually becoming a better player than its creator.
  - This illustrates a key principle: in general, **the more data (experience) a learning algorithm has, the better it will perform**.

### **Major Types of Machine Learning**

The two main categories of machine learning algorithms are:

1. **Supervised Learning:** This is the most widely used type of machine learning in real-world applications and is the focus of the first two courses in this specialization.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** This will be covered in the third course.

### **Focus on Practical Application üõ†Ô∏è**

- Beyond just learning the algorithms ("the tools"), this course emphasizes the **practical skills needed to apply them effectively**.
- Knowing _how_ and _when_ to use different techniques is crucial for building successful machine learning systems and avoiding common pitfalls that can waste significant time and effort.
