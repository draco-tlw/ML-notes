## **Jupyter Notebooks: The ML Workspace ðŸ““**

The **Jupyter Notebook** is the most widely used tool and development environment for machine learning and data science practitioners. This course uses the same professional-grade Jupyter Notebook environment that developers use in major tech companies.

### **Types of Labs in this Course**

1. **Optional Labs:**

   - These labs are designed to help you understand how machine learning code works without requiring you to write any yourself.
   - You only need to read the provided text and **run the existing code cells**.
   - They are completely optional and are not graded. Their purpose is to give you a deeper feel for the concepts.

2. **Practice Labs:**
   - Starting in Week 2, these labs will give you the opportunity to **write your own code**.

### **How to Use a Jupyter Notebook**

A notebook is made up of blocks called **cells**. There are two main types:

- **Markdown Cells:** These contain formatted text, like headings, descriptions, and explanations.
- **Code Cells:** These contain executable code (in this course, Python).

**Running a Cell:**

- To run the code or render the text in any selected cell, press **Shift + Enter** on your keyboard.
- You are encouraged to experiment by editing the code in the optional labs and running it again to see what happens.
