## **The Learning Rate (Œ±)**

The **learning rate**, denoted by the Greek letter `Œ±` (alpha), is a critical parameter in the gradient descent algorithm. It controls the size of the steps taken on each iteration, and choosing an appropriate value is essential for the algorithm's performance.

### **If the Learning Rate is Too Small üê¢**

- **Behavior:** The algorithm takes extremely small "baby steps" on each iteration.
- **Consequence:** Gradient descent will work, but it will be very **slow to converge**. It may take an excessive number of iterations to reach the minimum.

### **If the Learning Rate is Too Large üöÄ**

- **Behavior:** The algorithm takes huge steps, which can cause it to "overshoot" the minimum of the cost function. With each step, it might land on a point with an even higher cost than the previous one.
- **Consequence:** Gradient descent may **fail to converge** or even **diverge**, meaning the cost gets worse over time, moving further and further away from the minimum.

### **Behavior at a Local Minimum ‚úÖ**

- When the algorithm reaches a local minimum, the slope of the tangent line to the cost function is **zero**.
- This means the **derivative term in the update rule is zero**.
- The update becomes: $w := w - \alpha \cdot 0$, which simplifies to $w := w$.
- **Consequence:** The parameter `w` stops changing. The algorithm has successfully **converged** and will remain at the local minimum.

### **Natural Decrease in Step Size**

- Even with a **fixed learning rate `Œ±`**, the step sizes taken by gradient descent will **automatically get smaller** as the algorithm approaches a minimum.
- **Why?** As you get closer to the bottom of the "bowl," the slope of the cost function becomes less steep. This means the derivative term gets smaller, resulting in a smaller update to the parameters.
- This property allows the algorithm to take large steps when it's far from the minimum and smaller, more precise steps as it gets closer, helping it converge smoothly.
